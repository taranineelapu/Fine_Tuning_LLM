# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models Efficiently: A Case Study

-	To run the code file you need to install a few packages which are given in the code
-	This code file is self-sufficient, running each cell will give you the results
-	However, it is important to note that this code written and specifically designed for system with NVDIA GPU and driver
-	So, if your system does not have an NVDIA GPU this will throw the below error
 
-	This code file uses the “Llama-2-7b-chat-hf" as the base model which directly loaded and used from hugging face
-	The dataset is also downloaded from hugging face which is “guanaco-llama2-1k"
